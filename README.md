# resRand.php
A PHP object for Restricted Randomisation; a direct port of [resRand.js](https://github.com/Loycifer/resRand.js)

##Why use the PHP version?

Using PHP can be a little more complicated than using JavaScript due to the fact that running PHP scripts requires a server and an interpreter.

However, PHP allows for writing and saving to external files, something which JavaScript can not do very well.

Thus, the creation of stimulus lists, and possibly the creation of entire scripts for programs such as [E-Prime](https://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm) or [Neurobehavioral Systems' Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/), can be easily automated using PHP.

The object works identically to its JavaScript counterpart, so you should be able to use the [resRand.js Readme](https://github.com/Loycifer/resRand.js/blob/master/README.md) for instructions, provided you are proficient in PHP.
